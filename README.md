# Pollhub

**Pollhub** is a simple application for creating, managing, and participating in polls. Built with **Elixir** and **Phoenix LiveView**.

---

## **Features**
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login using email and password, implemented via Phoenix's built-in auth generator.
- **Poll Management**: Create, edit, and delete polls through an interface.
- **Participation**: Users can view poll entries and cast votes.

---

## **Project Structure**

### **Live Views**
- `index.ex`
    - Displays all existing polls with options to create, edit, or delete a poll.

- `show.ex`
    - Displays a specific poll's details. Allows users to view entries, participate in voting, and edit polls if needed.

### **Live Component**
- `form_component.ex`
    - A shared component used for creating or editing polls. It provides reusable form logic and rendering, shared between the `index.ex` and `show.ex` live views.

### **Rendering**
Each LiveView and component has its own `.heex` file responsible for rendering its HTML structure.

        - `name` (string): The poll's title.
        - `entries` (array): Associated entries for the poll.

2. **Entry** (`entry.ex`)
    - Fields:
        - `title` (string): Entry title.
        - `votes` (integer): Number of votes received.
        - `poll_id` (foreign key): Links to the associated poll.

3. **Participation** (`participation.ex`)
    - Fields:
        - `poll_id` (foreign key): ID of the poll.
        - `user_id` (foreign key): ID of the user who has participated.
